#### Unbreak things

# Prevent tmux from messing up keybindings and colors.
# This is witchcraft, I have no explanation for the following commands.
set -g xterm-keys on
setw -g xterm-keys on
set -g default-terminal "xterm-256color"

# Prevent tmux from waiting half a second before processing the ESC key, see:
# http://unix.stackexchange.com/a/25638/176805
set -s escape-time 0

# Enable proper mouse support:
# http://www.hamvocke.com/blog/a-guide-to-customizing-your-tmux-conf/
set -g mouse on

# The following line prevents a weird OS X problem that otherwise keep
# the "open" command from working (and has several other undesirable
# properties; see issue #120). For more details on the issue, see
# [1]-[5].
#
# The exact version of the solution below is the only way I have found
# to satisfy all of the following properties:
#
# * It fixes the problem, i.e. "open" works correctly.
#
# * When opening a new window in tmux, the window name is correctly
#   set to zsh initially. It does not briefly flash
#   "reattach-to-user-namespace".
#
# * The "automatic-rename" property is still set to "on" in new tmux
#   windows, meaning that if you run another program, the window name
#   will change to reflect that (unless you manually rename the
#   window).
#
# * Exiting the shell (e.g. with Control+D) will immediately kill the
#   tmux window instead of dropping you into another shell.
#
# Note that this command would need to be modified to support other
# login shells (e.g. bash). It appears that tmux takes the first word
# of the command literally in order to determine the initial window
# name, so it's not possible to just replace "zsh" with "$SHELL".
#
# Also, this command would need to be modified to work on Linux (where
# reattach-to-user-namespace will not be installed, because the
# problem only occurs on OS X).

#### Status bar

# The following code is adapted from:

# but sidesteps the environment/configuration hell which that project
# introduces.

# Format to display on the left-hand side of the status bar.
# Note that the conditional #{?cond,true,false} operator does not do any
# fancy parsing, so you can't have literal commas in the conditions --
# this will cause the conditions to be split up. So we have to use multiple
# style #[attr=value] directives.
